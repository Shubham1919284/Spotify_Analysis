# 🎶 Spotify Top 50 World – Power BI Dashboard

This repository hosts my **Power BI** dashboard project analyzing Spotify’s Top 50 Global songs data.  
My goal: uncover trends in song popularity, albums, artists, and design a beautiful, Spotify-themed interactive dashboard.

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset includes (for each song/chart entry):  
- `song` — name of the track  
- `artist` — the performing artist  
- `date` — date when charted  
- `popularity` — Spotify’s popularity score (0–100)  
- `duration_ms` — track duration in milliseconds  
- `album_type` — e.g. single, album, compilation  
- `total_tracks` — number of tracks in that album  
- `release_date` — when the album or track was released  
- `is_explicit` — boolean indicating explicit content

## 🛠 Technical & Measures

Here’s a subset of important DAX measures (defined inside a `_Measures` table) used in this dashboard:

```DAX
MEASURE '_Measures'[Total Songs] = COUNTROWS('Top-50-world')
MEASURE '_Measures'[Distinct Artists] = DISTINCTCOUNT('Top-50-world'[artist])
MEASURE '_Measures'[Avg Popularity] = AVERAGE('Top-50-world'[popularity])
MEASURE '_Measures'[Best Position] = MIN('Top-50-world'[position])
MEASURE '_Measures'[Oldest Release Year] = MINX('Top-50-world', YEAR('Top-50-world'[release_date]))
… (other measures as in project)
These are used in KPI cards, charts, and slicer logic (Month/Quarter switching).
```

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Shubham1919284/Spotify_Analysis.git
Open the .pbit or .pbix file (whichever you used) in Power BI Desktop.

Interact with slicers and visuals; your measures and filters are already embedded.

Optionally, you can export to Power BI Service (if you sign in) to share.
